# netdiagram
In this project, I created the network diagram for a advertising company with 31 employees. In the company, there are 3 job duties, advertising consultants, graphic designers and office coordinators. There are 15 advertising consultants, 10 graphic designers, and 6 office coordinators.
The company has a plan to hire more people in the next 3 years, due to the growth of the industry. The data of the company is not centrally managed, secured and cannot be recovered if something happend. 
The company is following the PCI compliance to secure and protect credit card date provided by our customers and transmitted though card processing transactions.
